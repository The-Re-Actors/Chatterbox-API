# Collaboration Process

We used a Kanban board with Miro to track and identify each team member's task \
For issues, we would bring them up on our zoom room and deal with it in pair \
Our strategy was to always look at our project from the user angle and test each user story 

# Technologies used:

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Socket.io (for real time messaging)


# Routes to API:
- ```POST  /sign-up```  Sign up  
- ```POST  /sign-in```  Sign in 
- ```PATCH  /change-password```  Change password
- ```DELETE  /sign-out```  Sign out
- ```POST  /profile```  Create profile
- ```PATCH  /profile/:id```  Update profile
- ```DELETE  /profile/:id```  Delete profile

# Unsolved Problems:
- Upload user profile picture
